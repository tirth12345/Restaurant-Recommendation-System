# Task: Restaurant Recommendation

## Objective:
    Create a restaurant recommendation system based on user preferences.

## Steps:
    Preprocess the dataset by handling missing
    values and encoding categorical variables.
    Determine the criteria for restaurant
    recommendations (e.g., cuisine preference,
    price range).
    Implement a content-based filtering
    approach where users are recommended
    restaurants similar to their preferred criteria.
    Test the recommendation system by
    providing sample user preferences and
    evaluating the quality of recommendations
